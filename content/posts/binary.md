Hey!  I'm `inside content`.
Audience: 

- simpler logic, simpler to build
- base 10 system -> base 2 -> hexadecimal
- make imgs using binary (paint by number)
- using binary on existing imgs (threshold)
- code presentation: history of binary
- analog vs pwm: on/off vs dimmer/spectrum
- barcodes, KR code, AR icons (CV)
- pre-electronics: mechanical handdriven calculator -> mechanical challenge, relied on gears
- 30s-40s (electronics): vacuum tubes, anode/cathode (on/off) logic
