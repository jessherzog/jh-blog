Naturally when transitioning from being a homeroom second grade teacher to a Science teacher for both first and second grade, many changes arise.  Some of the changes are exciting, like when you discover bits of design thinking and creative problem solving while studying the first units, or the simple fact that you won't have to be rapidly oscillating between Math and Literacy all day... or the maybe the most simple fact of all:  another new year brings that mystically reassuring feeling that I am coming into it having learned *so much more* than how I started the year before. 

In the final months of the last school year, we switched to teaching remotely.  We stuck to basics and relatively, [did quite well](https://nypost.com/2020/05/17/success-academy-making-remote-learning-work-as-regular-schools-flail/).  We prioritized technology access/connection, attendance, engagement, and reading.  As a school we made growth, not to mention my class finished on top in Math (which was huge). This fall, we're diving deep into content, mimicking as much in-school learning systems as possible.  

It would honestly pain me to bore you any further, dear reader, with my opinion on remote work [in these unprecedented times](https://twitter.com/yayalexisgay/status/1283065952620306432?s=20).  It doesn't vary greatly from any other occasional freelancer (ie homebody with a BFA) with a disdain for breakroom keurig coffee:  Working from home has been a delight and I'm grateful for the privilege beyond words. 

Just as teaching Science has (very obviously) helped me reach my goal to teach more STEM-specific material, remote learning has (slightly less obviously) helped me find direct use for my digital design background as a teacher.  Well to be fair, my coworkers would definitely give it up when they saw my bulletin boards or walked into my classroom.  But for the vast majority of the school year, I had to continue honing close-to-foreign skills (try the single skill of just: working with kids).  

Once our school went remote, I started casually flaunting my digital design skills around as if they were a pair of abercrombie jeans in a middle school hallway.
